***A set of tools and utilities for Minecraft***

**Now made in Rust!**

Welcome to Minety, a set of tools and utilities for Minecraft. This project is based on the original idea of creating a [Minecraft world cleaner](https://gist.github.com/jotalanusse/ee5b75aba847ce44a4a14834f424a59d).

The scope of this project is to provide a set of tools that users can easily use to modify/clean/analyze Minecraft worlds and files. The current goal is to implement the following functionality:

- World utilities:
	 - Analyzer:
		 - Identify unused chunks/regions
		 - Search for blocks/items/players
	 - Cleaner:
		 - Delete unused chunks/regions
		 - Delete/backup/keep player constructions
	 - Grapher:
	     - Create a 2D/heatmap/topological map

**Note:** This project is experimental, use these tools at your own risk, if they alter/break/modify your Minecraft world or installation in an unintended way it's on you. *Always* make a backup of your files before using this tool.

*But if you ever find this project useful please let us know :)*
